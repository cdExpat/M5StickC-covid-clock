# M5StickC-covid-clock


Yet another M5Stick-C clock, but added covid-19 data and temperature/humidity reading from BME280. The BME280 reading is only performed when the BME280 is connected to the grove-interface.

Click on the power button, and you will put the stick in deep sleep, the home button (M5) will wake up the device.

Clicking on the B-button will increase the brightness (unless in the update screen where it will update the Covid-19 data if available). Clicking the home button will scroll through the different screens.

You can add 3 different WiFi connections, for security reasons I replaced mine with ***** :-)
